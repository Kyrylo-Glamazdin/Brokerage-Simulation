# Mock Investment

This project is a simulation of the basic functionality of an online stock brokerage. Built with Swift & UIKit. Here you can:
* Browse stocks and look up their real prices
* Simulate buying stocks
* Simulate selling stocks
* Create and modify your own stock portfolio
* View the value of your portfolio based on the actual stock market data
* See how successful your investment decisions would be over time

# Installation
* 1) Clone the repo and open the Xcode project file.
* 2) Create your [Finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/) API key (to obtain real stock prices)
* 3) Create a Finnhub-Info.plist file in the MockInvestment folder. Set the key to 
`
API_KEY
`
 and the value to your API key from [Finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/).
 * 4) Run the app either using iOS simulation or by connecting your actual iOS device with a USB cable.
